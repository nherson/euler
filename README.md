Euler
=====

A collection of solutions to problems posed on Project Euler.  All implementations are in C.


Adding Solutions
----------------

Write the C code and place the file in the `src` with the name `problemX`.


Compiling
---------

As long as you follow the "Adding Solutions" section above, compiling a solution to problem X should be as simple as `make problemX`.  Compiling all solutions is done with just `make`.


Solution Explanation
--------------------

Explanations (if any), will be found in the individual source files as comments.
